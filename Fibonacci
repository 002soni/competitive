Sri has a list of all Fibonacci numbers modulo 10^13. This list is infinite, it starts with numbers 0 and 1. Each number in the list, apart from the first two, is a sum of the previous two modulo 10^13. That is, Sri's list is made from the Fibonacci numbers' list by replacing each number there by the remainder when divided by 10^13.

Sri got interested in number f (0 ≤ f < 10^13) and now wants to find its first occurrence in the list given above. Help Sri and find the number of the first occurrence of number f in the list or otherwise state that number f does not occur in the list.

The numeration in Sri's list starts from zero. There, the 0-th position is the number 0, the 1-st position is the number 1, the 2-nd position is the number 1, the 3-rd position is the number 2, the 4-th position is the number 3, and so on. Thus, the beginning of the list looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, …

Input

The first line contains the single integer f (0 ≤ f < 10^13) — the number, which position in the list we should find.

Output

Print a single number — the number of the first occurrence of the given number in Sri's list. If this number doesn't occur in Sri's list, print -1.
